	<h1>Hello</h1>
<p>My name is Apurav ( call me Apu or Rav; whatever you feel Sounds cool ). I am an International student from a small city "Kurukshetra" in India, Where the longest epic of world (Mahabharata) was written. "https://youtu.be/VKeCBO11-Mo"</p><p>I studied Designing back in my country and now I wanted to learn code to be a futureproof designer who can also handle front-end designing with knowledge of video and 3D as an asset. I don't have much experience with professional communications because i have never worked in a really professional environment and talking about Online learning, I have taken few course online, so i am familiar with online courses.</p><p>I have few goals after completing my college like I want to do job in Designing and development for few years and then establishing my own designing company. Other than Professional goals I also want to help poor children with their education back in my country in hope of providing them brighter future.</p><p>I don't have any specific hobby other than Cooking food (Probably the best Indian food you ever had) and spending time with friends. However I am really easy going with hobbies of other people so if you have an extra ticket of music concert, football, ice hockey, basketball. I will love to join.</p>
